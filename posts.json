    "content": "Who pays for each service depends on what the company would like to do. Once the company deploys Espresa, it has to decide which services are subsidized. Services can be 100 percent funded by the company, costs can be shared 50-50 between company and employee or the employee can pay 100 percent. Another option for the company is providing employees with $100 (or more) a month and letting them decide how to spend it on the platform. “The platform can take care of both models,” Shubat said."

I used the system with my 15-inch MacBook Pro (against doctor’s orders) and got a couple of extra hours at full charge. I’ll be bringing my 13-inch work MacBook Air to IFA with me in a couple of weeks, and the Omnicharge will definitely be coming along for the ride."

    "content": "And before you even ask, Plugless has a network of installers who do this part for Model S owners, included in the cost of purchase (currently $2,440 per system). The add-on won’t affect your warranty, either — even though Tesla and Plugless don’t have any official relationship, and Plugless is strictly an aftermarket add-on, so long as the Plugless system doesn’t negatively affect the vehicle there’s no effect on your warranty. Plus, the company tells me it offers its own three-year warranty that will cover the cost of any impact its system has on your car, though it hasn’t run into any issues with its add-ons for other vehicles"
